# dns

This is a temporary solution to evilfactorylabs' DNS resolution. Maybe in the future we should move to DigitalOcean DNS as
the website www.evilfactorylabs.org is hosted there.

| Name | Type  | URL |
|------|------|------|
| Namecheap | Domain Registry | https://ap.www.namecheap.com
| LuaDNS | DNS Authoritative Server | https://luadns.com

All credentials reside at [evilfactorylabs/pass](https://github.com/evilfactorylabs/pass) and if you are a member of @evilfactorylabs/core you
should get access to the private key plus the passphrase.
